# Hand Cricket
Hand Cricket is a computer vision-based game. The rules are simple. 
- Two players play in turn, one batting and the other bowling.
- Both show fingers at the same time. The batsman scores the number of runs equal to the finger shown if the finger count does not match. Thumb accounts for six runs.
- The batsman gets out if both show thumb or the same number of fingers.
- The player scoring the most runs wins. In the case of the same runs, the match is considered a draw.

The game is implemented using Mediapipe, OpenCV, and other libraries. Some open-source code snippets were used while developing it.
