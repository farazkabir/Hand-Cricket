# Hand Cricket
Hand Cricket is a computer vision based game. The rules are simple. 
- Two players play in turn, one batting and other bowling.
- Both show fingers at the same time. The batsman scores the number of runs if the finger count does not match. Thumb accounts for 6 runs.
- The batsman gets out if both shows thumb or same number of fingers
- The player scoring most runs win. In case of same runs, the match is considered draw.

The game is implemented using Mediapipe, OpenCV and other librarees. Some open source code snippets were used while developing it.
